Engineering_CourseWork_Programs

Hello,

    My name is Stephen Apolinar.  I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering Student at The University of Texas at San Antonio, 
also known as UTSA.  I am currently employed as Mechanical Engineering Intern at BioMedical Enterprises.  I served in the 
U.S. Air Force, and Texas Air National Guard for over 9 years.  It was my pleasure to maintain the F-16 Fighting Falcon as 
a Machinist.  I also maintained Minute Man 3 Nuclear missiles the first 3 years of my military career.  You know....... those 
big ones that go in the ground that will blow us all to "HELL!!!"  My goal as an Engineer is to be able to Conceptualize, 
Design, and Fabricate.

    My goal for this project is to create a hub to share programs, with fellow students, for Engineering course work and 
applications.  Myself, and another student, are currently in the begining stages of creating a UTSA Python User Group as an 
Official UTSA Student Organization.  We can use the organzation to improve our coding skills, Engineering proficiency, as 
well as expanding the Python user base.

Stephen
